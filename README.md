# Dockers

**A collection of some essential docker compose.**

Docker, a platform that allows users to easily pack, distribute, and manage applications within containers. In other words, It is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.

Docker really makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers, and containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can be assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

### Benefits of Using Docker

2. Simplicity and Faster Configurations
3. Rapid Deployment
3. Isolation

### How to run
Go to the perticular binaries folder and run
